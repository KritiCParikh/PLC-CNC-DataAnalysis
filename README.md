# PLC-CNC-DataAnalysis

## Introduction

The project is focused on analyzing data collected from Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) in CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines. The goal of this project is not only to monitor the operational performance of these machines and detect anomalies but also to provide actionable insights and suggestions for improving machine efficiency and reliability.

This project was inspired by my experience at Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), where I worked as a Trainee, Data. During my time there, I gained hands-on experience with the various components of CNC machines and developed an understanding of the critical role PLCs play in industrial automation and manufacturing. Building on this foundation, I further advanced into this data analysis project to simulate real-world industrial conditions, detect potential issues, and recommend betterment strategies. By identifying performance bottlenecks, error patterns, and other inefficiencies, this project strives to offer practical suggestions to enhance the operational effectiveness of CNC machines.

## Steps Taken

This project was approached systematically to simulate, analyze, and optimize the performance of CNC machines, inspired by real-world industrial scenarios. Below are the key steps undertaken:

### 1. Simulating Real-Time Data

- Synthetic real-time data was generated to replicate the operational conditions of CNC machines, inspired by my experience at Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL).
- Key performance metrics such as processor load, memory usage, power supply voltage, and cycle time were simulated to reflect typical machine operations.

### 2. Conducting Root Cause Analysis

- Root causes of detected anomalies and performance bottlenecks were investigated.
- Correlations between issues and specific components or operational conditions, such as spikes in processor load or memory usage, were identified and analyzed.

### 3. Detecting Anomalies

- Algorithms were developed and implemented to detect anomalies within the simulated data.
- Statistical and machine learning techniques, including Z-score analysis and moving averages, were employed to identify performance degradation, error spikes, and power supply irregularities.
- Abnormal behavior in the CNC operations was flagged for further investigation.

### 4. Calculating Performance Metrics

- Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) was calculated to measure the CNC machines' availability, performance, and quality.
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) was determined to assess the reliability of the machines.
- The impact of detected anomalies on these performance metrics was thoroughly analyzed.

### 5. Visualization Findings

- Visualizations were created to effectively communicate the findings and recommendations.
